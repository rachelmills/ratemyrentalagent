			<p id="one">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistic
				(ABS), almost one-third of households in Australia rent their homes.
				As a long-term renter in the Brisbane area I have experienced some
				very good service and some very poor service from rental agencies.</p>
			<p id="two">An important part of the rental process is filling
				out the application form. Prospective tenants are required to
				declare a huge amount of personal information, including work
				details, wage slips, personal references, work references and
				previous addresses. Whilst there may be a valid reason for having to
				divulge such a large amount of personal information, it is very much
				a one-way process. The prospective tenant will be able to learn very
				little about the landlord/landlady and/or the rental agency.</p>
			<p id="three">The purpose of this website is to help prospective
				tenants make more informed choices by sharing feedback on their own
				experiences with rental agencies.</p>
